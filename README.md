# Math_Maze
This is a Math Maze created by me and Antonisvar for a university project in the course of  E-learning. The main idea of the project is to create a serious game.

## Description:
Design and implement an educational interactive e-learning application or a Serious game (SG), which will:
Has the objective of education (e.g. learning programming, mathematics, physics, etc.), the acquisition of skills/abilities 
It can refer to any sector, such as: education, business, health, risk management, tourism and heritage, advertising, scientific investigation.

## Α. Basic Application Structure

### Training Material
The educational material should be provided to users with images, video, text, etc. in a friendly learning environment.

### Evaluation
The assessment of students should be done with different types of questions (e.g. multiple choice, matching, etc.)

### Statistics & Learning Analytics
The student will be able to view their statistics, e.g., grades on chapter exams and on the retest, etc.

### Feedback
During the student's interaction with the system, he/she will be shown messages which will have one or more of the following types:
a) learning incentives and/or 
b) advice (e.g. "The next chapter is hard. Be careful!") and/or feedback messages (e.g. if he/she got a high grade, display "Well done, you did great!")

### Posting to a Learning Management System (LMS)
Create within an LMS platform (e.g. moodlecloud.com) a course with the module you have chosen and post the learning material, your learning application and the assessment method (e.g. quiz). 
The link from the virtual course to the LMS should be included in your report, as well as relevant screenshots. Be sure to include the details of a user.

## Β. Analysis & Design

### In order to achieve the objectives of the educational application/ serious game it is important to:

1) Clearly define the objective of the application and the learners (age, gender, culture, etc.) it is aimed at and the expected benefits.
2) Pay attention to the content and activities to be incorporated to achieve the objectives of the application, which should be accurate and complete.
3) The learner should learn as he or she interacts with the application.
4) The potential benefits should be commensurate with the workload and time required to complete the activities.
5) Rewards & incentives are provided as recognition of achievements, but also as motivation for those close to the target to try harder.
6) The application should provide feedback to the player especially in case of mistakes.
7) The application should provide structured scaffolding for the player to achieve the defined goals.
